## Why Diversity Matters

A diverse environment is important for understanding and respecting other points of view and facilitating rich collaborations. In the anthropology field it is said: *understanding "the other" helps to understand oneself*. In the field of music technology, as it also happens in other STEM fields, there is a well-known problem of lack of diversity. As a woman in music technology, Overall, my actions are committed to diversity and equity in higher education and the music technology industry. 

## We Are Agents of Change

We can be agents of change. As part of the [WAC 2016](http://webaudio.gatech.edu/) committee, we included a travel grant program that looked into increasing diversity in the WAC conference hosted at Georgia Tech, and made sure that there was gender parity in the [keynote speakers](http://webaudio.gatech.edu/keynotes). Even though all our efforts, the number of female attendees was low. What was the problem?

I took it as a personal research and conducted a series of informal interviews with women in the field of music technology at different stages of their life: an undergrad student, two grad students, an early career lecturer, a high school teacher, and a music technology's program coordinator. In April 2016, I was invited as a [keynote speaker in conversation with Liz Dobson](http://wiswos.bitbucket.org/index.html%3Fp=435.html) at the event *Women in Sound Women on Sound on Educating Girls into Sound*, held in Lancaster, UK. We discussed the findings and continued the discussion at the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology (GTCMT) department. Then, we decided to create [Women in Music Tech](http://www.gtcmt.gatech.edu/) to sustainably bring more women into the program, an organization of which I was co-chair from 2017 to 2018.

## Women in Music Tech (2017-2018)

[Women in Music Tech (WiMT)](http://www.gtcmt.gatech.edu/womeninmusictech) has been an exciting adventure. This organization has been possible with the collaboration of everyone from the GTCMT department: students, staff, and faculty members. We were also in conversations with a number of organizations and individuals from Georgia Tech that are collaborating, supporting, and helping us to define our agenda. During the first year, we programmed outreach events, launched a bi-monthly newsletter, and made sure that there was a safe and respectful space for everybody. With only one year of actions, the graduate level of applications improved, although still not ideal (female participation 21.1% (2015–16), 16.3% (2016–17), 25.4% (2017–18)). Our next milestone was to create a sustainable organization. 

## WiNIME (2018)

As a follow up of WiMT, I looked into the underrepresentation of women at the New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference in the paper [Who Are the Women Authors in NIME? - Improving Gender Balance in NIME Research”](http://annaxambo.me/pub/Xambo_2018_WiNIME.pdf) (Xambó 2018) and created the [WiNIME directory](https://axambo.github.io/directory-of-winime/).

## What else Can We Do?

As agents of change, we can improve our environment establishing constant dialogue with our co-workers in the department about our actions and achievements related to improving the representation of women in music technology. Furthermore, attending events related to diversity, such as the [Diversity Symposium 2016](http://www.diversity.gatech.edu/diversitysymposium) at Georgia Tech, is important to network, join forces and share current issues and future strategies.
